### Description

I recently started working on a huge Visual basic program (150+ forms). I needed a quick way to find what was calling what. After not finding anything, I made this. It basically loops through the vbp, frm and bas files to develop a relationship of forms in a tree control. Beware, there is some spaghetti in this app. Enjoy!
 
### More Info
 
Visual Basic VBP file, and all associated frm and bas files.

Tree view of application form calls and a text file output of the map.
